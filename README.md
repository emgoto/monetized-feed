## Adding a blog with monetized RSS feeds

I've created a test blog at [https://gatsby-monetized-rss.netlify.app](https://gatsby-monetized-rss.netlify.app).

You'll be able to add its two RSS feed on the settings page:

- https://gatsby-monetized-rss.netlify.app/rss.xml
- https://gatsby-monetized-rss.netlify.app/secrethiddenrss.xml
